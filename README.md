# My-Tavern-Menu
Welcome to my second coding project.

It's my version of the second project featured in the learning path for the [Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) by freeCodeCamp.

This project taught me the beginning basics of CSS and how to combine it with HTML.

FreeCodeCamp has you make a Cafe menu but, I wanted to make a medieval tavern menu. 

I named it Swift Cloak Tavern because I was listening to Taylor Swift's song *The Archer* while making it. Medieval archer's are known for wearing cloaks so I combined the two.
